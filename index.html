       <p>Hello! My name is Turiq Johnson and I am an emerging professional on the Quality Assurance track at Year Up. As an aspiring QA Engineer, I feel like Year Up is the perfect oppritunity to dip my feet into the technology field.</p>
       
       <p>As someone who has no background in coding or software, this is all very new to me. Currently I have worked with HTML, Visual Studio code, and a little bit of CSS.</p>
       
       <p>Currently in my learning and development stage at Year Up, and taking in as much information as I can that will help me reach some goals I'm here to talk about. In about 4 and a half months, my goal is to get an internship and there I plan on dipping more of my foot into the field. This includes networking myself more, working with peers professionally, and more.</p>
       
       <p>As I said above, after putting my foot into the tech field my goal after internships is to secure a job. After the 6 month internship, the main goal would to get a job with the same respective company I interned at. The reason being is already knowing the companies in and outs, culture, code language and testing, etc.</p>
           
      <p>Now maneuvering around the field of technology is certainly not an easy process. It is vital that in the 6 months of learning and development, I learn how to network myself effectively and efficiently. I'm taking a Business Communications class where we will learn so much more than the coding material needed on the job. What does it mean when i say that? While working in IT, It's vital for everyone to know the business aspects in companies. Things like presenting ad-hoc reports, how to write business emails, effectively communicating proffesionally to co-workers, and much more.   </p>
